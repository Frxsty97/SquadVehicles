# SquadVehicles

SquadVehicles is an ongoing project that will eventually be a tool for players of Squad to use to confirm information about the vehicles on the Maps and Layers that they are playing.

This should allow them to start to quickly identify what vehicles are present in their game, as well as armour information.

No more will a call or mark be placed for a BMP when its actually a scout car. Valuable HAT ammo and time will be directed towards the correct locations.
